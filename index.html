Make your own step-by-step guide
================================

This template allows you to build a more advanced step-by-step guide.
The example theme here is for you to change as much as you like to
create appearance and content which are truly your own.

READ THROUGH THE COMMENTS. This is a comment. Everything inside of
this for HTML or '/*' for CSS, is not processed as code, but
instead are just text comments about the code. For this project, the
comments will give you instructions, hints and guides to completing
the project, so skim down through the comments to get an understanding
of what you are being asked to do.

GET ORIENTED IN THE CODE. HTML is made up of tags that look like
this <p> </p>. The tags tell you something about the information
contained between them. Click on the tags in the code on this side
of the editor to get a description of what each tag is for.

IN THIS CHALLENGE, YOU WILL LEARN ABOUT:

- HTML: Nested lists
- HTML: Unordered list
- HTML: Captions
- CSS: Borders
- CSS: Embedding images and videos

              <p>You have probably seen lots of films if you are interested in becoming a film director, but you can start to use your film viewing experiences as a way to learn about film making. Watch as many films as you can and pay attention to the details. Try to count at least 15 mistakes in each film you watch. Look for acting errors, editing errors, storyline continuity errors, etc.
Develop your awareness of storytelling as you watch films. Try watching movies with the sound off and pay attention to how the story unfolds through images as well. </p>

              <h3>Start making short films.</h3>
              <p>To become a director, it is important to get started right away and use any means necessary to make your own films. Get a camera if you don't already have one. Write your own screenplay or work with a friend who writes.
Get a group of friends together on the weekend and shoot scenes for a short film. Over time, you can edit the scenes together using a program like Adobe Premier. Making your own short films will give you a chance to wear multiple hats and develop different skill sets.

              <h3>Learn how to act.</h3>
              <p>The best way to learn to direct actors is by getting experience acting, whether this is by acting in your own films or being part of a drama group. Learning more about acting and doing some acting yourself will give you a greater appreciation for the actors that you are working with and it may make it easier to communicate with them. Try to learn the lingo of actors. For example, you can learn about different acting strategies or techniques, such as classical acting and method acting.

              <p> While you will probably start out writing your own scripts, you may need to work with other people’s scripts later on. Reading scripts that other people have written is a good way to practice bringing someone else’s story to life. When you read other people’s scripts, try to think about the details of how you would shoot each scene.</p>

              <h3>Consider going to film school.</h3>
              <p>Though it's totally not required, film school is great for three things: forced experience, access to crews, and networking. Plenty have made it who did not go to film school, but plenty more have made it who have. You'll have access to internships, workshops, and, most importantly, names, names, names. If you have a project, you can get a crew handed to you and you can network by helping others out, too. Although highly competitive, NYU, USC, University of California at Los Angeles, AFI (Los Angeles), and California Institute of the Arts are some of the top schools.</p>

              <h3>Work as part of a production crew.</h3>
              <p>Becoming a film director doesn't happen overnight. Most directors started out working as runners, camera operators, or performing other roles as part of a production crew. No job is too small. Whether it's filing paperwork, making sure the actors have their bagels, or watching over the camera equipment at night, it's a step in the right direction.</p>

              <p> Long story short, you won't become a director without a reel. That is the most important thing to have. That being said, this is definitely an industry where it's a lot easier to show said reel if you have an in. To get an in, you need to start networking right away. The more people you know, the more opportunities you will have. Attend industry events, such as mixers, conventions, parties, premiers, etc. Introduce yourself to people and try to develop good relationships with the people you meet. Offer to help out on future projects or invite others to work with you.</p>

              <p>our reel, or portfolio, is what you'll be submitting to any project that's looking for a director, so it is important to make sure that it is impressive. Models submit their modeling portfolios, actors submit their headshots and resumes, and directors submit their reels. Your reel should include information about your education, professional experience, and films.</p>

Then, you can sit back and enjoy your awesome job!</p>
